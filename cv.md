## Summary
I'm planning to become a software engineer, as this sphere allows creating meaningful technical solutions to customer's problems. I have technical background and experience in designing and constructing of electrical grids. The main thing of design projects I did is finding the best solutions to transfer electrical energy to the customers, taking into consideration the customer requirements and building density. I'm eager to learn and develop in the new sphere and spend all the time to become a good specialist.
